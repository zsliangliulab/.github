## About Us


### Overview
The BioNexus Platform (BP) is dedicated to advancing the field of bioinformatics through cutting-edge research, innovation, and collaboration. Our mission is to develop and apply computational tools and techniques to understand and interpret biological data, ultimately contributing to significant scientific discoveries and advancements in health and medicine. BioNexus signifies a comprehensive platform designed to be a central hub for bioinformatics research. It emphasizes the integration and connection of diverse biological data and tools, fostering an environment that supports innovative research and collaboration. The name conveys the idea of a powerful, user-friendly, and versatile platform that serves as a crucial point for advancing bioinformatics and biological sciences.

### Our Research
At BP, our research spans a wide range of topics in bioinformatics, including:

- **Genomics and Proteomics**: Analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences to understand the structure, function, and evolution of genes and proteins.
- **Computational Biology**: Developing algorithms and computational models to simulate biological processes and systems.
- **Systems Biology**: Integrating data from various biological sources to construct comprehensive models of cellular and organismal function.
- **Data Mining and Machine Learning**: Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights from large biological datasets.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Applying AI and machine learning methods to enhance biological data analysis and interpretation.
- **Biostatistics**: Applying statistical methods to design experiments and analyze biological data.

### Our Team
Our team is composed of interdisciplinary experts, including biologists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, all working together to push the boundaries of bioinformatics research. We are committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where diverse perspectives and expertise can thrive.

### Main Administrator
Prof. [Liang Liu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%98%E4%BA%AE/65680191), our main administrator, leads the Bioinformatics Platform with extensive experience in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
- Prof. Liu has been working as a pancreatic surgeon for over 20 years. He and his teammates committed to exploring the pattern of tumorigenesis, development and metastasis in pancreatic cancer, aiming to improve the long-term survival of pancreatic cancer. Clinically, his pancreatic disease center is one of the largest national referral centers in the largest university hospital in the east of China. This center accomplished over 2000 pancreatic operations per year, including over 1300 pancreatic malignant tumor resections. 
- Scientifically, through multiple advanced technologies, including high-throughput sequencing, protein profiling, spatial omics, molecular biology, and disease modeling approaches, they analyze the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence of pancreatic cancer and try to establish a multi-omics-based molecular classification of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They are also interested in identifying the specific cell clusters of tumor microenvironment (TME) and understanding the biological and molecular characteristics of these clusters. The knowledge of the immunosuppressive microenvironment by revealing the subtypes and metabolic characteristics of immune cells helps us establish the stratified and targeted treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Main Publications
Our team has contributed to numerous high-impact publications in the field of bioinformatics. Here are some of our most notable papers:

1. **A Distinguished Roadmap of Fibroblast Senescence in Predicting Immunotherapy Response and Prognosis Across Human Cancers.** - Chen D, et al., Gut. 2025;12(7):e2406624., [DOI: 10.1002/advs.202406624](https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/5/958.long)
2. **Comprehensive machine learning-generated classifier identifies pro-metastatic characteristics and predicts individual treatment in pancreatic cancer: A multicenter cohort study based on super-enhancer profiling.** - Chen D, et al., Theranostics. 2023;13(10):3290-3309., [DOI: 10.7150/thno.84978](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202406624)
3. **Pan-cancer analysis implicates novel insights of lactate metabolism into immunotherapy response prediction and survival prognostication** - Chen D, et al., J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2024;43(1):125., [DOI: 10.1186/s13046-024-03042-7](https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13046-024-03042-7)

### Collaborations and Partnerships
We believe in the power of collaboration and actively seek partnerships with academic institutions, industry, and healthcare organizations. These collaborations enable us to tackle complex biological questions and translate our research into real-world applications.

### Educational Initiatives
BP is also dedicated to education and training the next generation of bioinformatics researchers. We offer various programs, workshops, and seminars to equip students and professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in this dynamic field.
